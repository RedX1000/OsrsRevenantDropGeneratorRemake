# Osrs Revenant Drop Generator: Remake
Remake of my original Revenant Drop Generator program: 
https://github.com/RedX1000/OsrsRevenantDropGenerator

How to use
----------

1. Choose which revenant is being killed from the drop-down menu
2. Enter the number of revenants being killed, following these rules:
   * Numbers only
   * No leading zeroes (i.e. 001345)
   * Value must be greater than zero
3. Choose whether you're skulled or not for better drops on the uniques table
4. Choose whether display should pop up faster, or dynamically display but run slower
   * Fast Mode: Program runs faster, but data pops onto the screen when done (Default)
   * Fancy Mode: Program runs slower, but data increments dynamically during runtime
5. Press the button to run the script and wait.
6. Voila!
